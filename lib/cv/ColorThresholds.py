# Color space is a specific organization of colors
# They provide a way to categorize colors and represent them in digital images

# RGB Thresholding doesn't work well under varying light conditions
# or under varying color like yellow

# HLS Thresholding isolates lightness (L), which varies most under
# different lighting conditions.
# H and S channels stay consistent in shadow or excessive brightness

# HLS can be used to detect lane lines of different colors under
    # different lighting conditions

# Hue - represents color independent of any change in brightness
# Lightness and Value - represent different ways to measure relative
    # lightness or darkness of a color
# Saturation - measurement of colorfulness
    # As colors get lighter (white), their saturation value is lower
    # Most intense colors (bright red, blue , yellow) have high saturation
